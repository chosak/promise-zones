There are 13 awarded Promise Zones to date.\r\n\r\nA modified version of the excellent [twarc](https://github.com/edsu/twarc) tool was used to retrieve available tweets from with the rough geographic boundaries of the Promise Zones.Because this tool uses the [Twitter Search API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search), results are limited to \"a sampling of recent Tweets published in the past 7 days\".\r\n\r\n[ESRI Shapefiles](http://egis.hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a10cbd9187a34bd2a28574a3cfe12e64_0) containing the boundaries of the PZs were used to obtain a rough center point and circular radius within which to search. Ideally, the exact polygonal boundary should be used to filter out tweets from outside of the PZ, especially in urban areas. Note that additionally the returned tweets include those from users whose profile includes a location inside the PZ, even if their tweets are not geolocated.\r\n\r\n### Raw data\r\n\r\n| Promise Zone | Tweets |\r\n| -------------|-------|\r\n| Camden City |  1,691 |\r\n| Choctaw Nation |  3,200 |\r\n| Indianapolis East | 1,426 |\r\n| Kentucky Highlands | 1,100 |\r\n| Los Angeles | 17,900 |\r\n| Minneapolis | 1,500 |\r\n| North Hartford | 435 |\r\n| Pine Ridge | 74 |\r\n| Sacramento | 6,000 |\r\n| San Antonio Eastside | 7,900 |\r\n| South Carolina | 1,800 |\r\n| St. Louis | 9,893 |\r\n| West Philadelphia | 1,800 |",
